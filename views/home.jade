        p Github restricts the number of times you can fork a repo into a single account. Even then, after forking, you are bound to the upstream in your repo page, which if you are doing an iterative work can sometimes be a hinderance to marketing. There are hacks and workarounds for this, but <strong>manualfork</strong> provides a user-friendly UI to apply them without command line knowledge.

          | Break From Upstream
        p Making a brand new iterative work? What do you do if you want to fork and break from the upstream entirely? With normal forking, your repo will always link back to the upstream version next to the title, but <strong>manualfork</strong> gives you the power to break free and start fresh.
